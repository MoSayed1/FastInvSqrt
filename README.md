## Super Breakout
https://github.com/ecs160ss12019/FastInvSqrt
<p>The goal of this project is to create a clone of the Atari 2600 game *Super Breakout*, possibly with expansions on top of the already existing game. Currently, we are aiming to replicate the original game modes and tentatively adding more features such as powerups and non-monochromatic simplistic graphics.</p>
<p>Currently, we have not split up the workload in regards to each individual member.</p>
